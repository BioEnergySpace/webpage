      <title>Weight Gain on a Ray Peat Inspired Diet</title>

      <description>A common phenomenon that many people experience when starting a Ray Peat-inspired diet is weight gain. From the outside, this may seem like an obvious consequence of eating a diet that encourages things like sugar, ice cream, and coconut oil. This is nonsense, but there are real reasons why many people find it difficult to maintain their weight on a Peat-inspired diet. The good news is that this weight gain is completely optional and results from a misunderstanding of Rayâ€™s thoughts.</description>

      <title>Ray Peats Early Thoughts on Protein</title>

      <description>Up until the last few years of his life, Ray consistently advocated at least 80 grams of high-quality, balanced protein for women, and more for men. His later shift to a lower protein diet, which could be due to his older age, was meant to lower mTOR activity, which is known to be associated with aging and degenerative changes. But we must not interpret this move to a lower protein diet as a general recommendation.</description>

      <title>Chronic Disease: A Bioenergetic Paradigm</title>

      <description>INTRODUCTION What are chronic diseases? What distinguishes multiple sclerosis from a broken leg? Both involve damage to the organism, but while most acute diseases like fractures or cuts tend to either kill or resolve, chronic disease is usually persistent. Currently, there is no overarching medical framework that tries to explain the general features of chronic disease, and therefore also provide universal therapeutic intervention points that are independent of the particular disease.</description>

      <title>Fatigue Is Not Just Atp</title>

      <description>ATP is rapidly replenished within a muscle after a single repetition of lifting maximum weight (1RM), yet strength remains reduced for days. This phenomenon is observed both in muscle fatigue studies and among experienced powerlifters. The question is: Why does it happen? Mainstream cellular physiology, with its emphasis on membranes, pumps, channels, and &amp;ldquo;high-energy&amp;rdquo; phosphate bonds, falls short in providing an answer.
1RM lifts require maximal muscle activation and contraction, initiated by a significant increase in intracellular calcium.</description>

      <title>Lifting the Hans Selye Way</title>

      <description>The question of exercise within Peat-related circles has often been a topic of debate. While Ray Peat has repeatedly discouraged &amp;ldquo;breathless&amp;rdquo; exercise that may increase lactic acid, he has expressed more favorable views towards concentric weightlifting. Increasing and maintaining a significant amount of muscle mass not only promotes health (muscles burn Free Fatty Acids at rest) but also proves beneficial in various aspects of life. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore weightlifting methods that align with bioenergetic principles.</description>
