      <description>ATP is rapidly replenished within a muscle after a single repetition of lifting maximum weight (1RM), yet strength remains reduced for days. This phenomenon is observed both in muscle fatigue studies and among experienced powerlifters. The question is: Why does it happen? Mainstream cellular physiology, with its emphasis on membranes, pumps, channels, and &amp;ldquo;high-energy&amp;rdquo; phosphate bonds, falls short in providing an answer.
1RM lifts require maximal muscle activation and contraction, initiated by a significant increase in intracellular calcium.</description>

      <description>The question of exercise within Peat-related circles has often been a topic of debate. While Ray Peat has repeatedly discouraged &amp;ldquo;breathless&amp;rdquo; exercise that may increase lactic acid, he has expressed more favorable views towards concentric weightlifting. Increasing and maintaining a significant amount of muscle mass not only promotes health (muscles burn Free Fatty Acids at rest) but also proves beneficial in various aspects of life. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore weightlifting methods that align with bioenergetic principles.</description>
