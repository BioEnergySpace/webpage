      <description>INTRODUCION What is chronic disease? What distinguishes multiple sclerosis from a broken leg? Both involve damage to the organism, but while most acute diseases like fractures or cuts tend to either kill or resolve, chronic disease is usually persistent.
We know that in most cases it has at least some degenerative character, while also having long periods of stability, and in some people spontaneous remissions happen. Currently there is no overarching medical framework that tries to explain the general features of chronic disease, and therefore also provide universal therapeutic intervention points that are independent of the particular disease.</description>

      <description>ATP is rapidly replenished within a muscle after a single repetition of lifting maximum weight (1RM), yet strength remains reduced for days. This phenomenon is observed both in muscle fatigue studies and among experienced powerlifters. The question is: Why does it happen? Mainstream cellular physiology, with its emphasis on membranes, pumps, channels, and &amp;ldquo;high-energy&amp;rdquo; phosphate bonds, falls short in providing an answer.
1RM lifts require maximal muscle activation and contraction, initiated by a significant increase in intracellular calcium.</description>

      <description>The question of exercise within Peat-related circles has often been a topic of debate. While Ray Peat has repeatedly discouraged &amp;ldquo;breathless&amp;rdquo; exercise that may increase lactic acid, he has expressed more favorable views towards concentric weightlifting. Increasing and maintaining a significant amount of muscle mass not only promotes health (muscles burn Free Fatty Acids at rest) but also proves beneficial in various aspects of life. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore weightlifting methods that align with bioenergetic principles.</description>
