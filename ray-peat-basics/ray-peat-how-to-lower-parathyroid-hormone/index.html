  <p>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays a crucial role in regulating calcium levels in the blood and is vital for bone health. However, elevated levels of PTH can lead to various health issues such as insomnia, seizures, dementia, psychosis, cancer, heart disease, respiratory distress, osteoporosis, inflammation, and soft tissue calcification. According to Ray Peat, several dietary factors can influence the production of PTH.</p>
<h5 id="phosphate-and-pth-production">Phosphate and PTH Production</h5>
<p>Peat notes that phosphate, abundant in grains, beans, nuts, meats, and fish, increases the production of PTH. This is significant because as we age, PTH levels naturally increase, which can suppress immunity and lead to several health problems​​.</p>
<h5 id="calcium-magnesium-and-vitamin-d-inhibitors-of-pth">Calcium, Magnesium, and Vitamin D: Inhibitors of PTH</h5>
<p>Contrary to phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D inhibit PTH production. Peat highlights that a low intake of calcium, for example, can increase the risk of kidney stones. Increased intake of these nutrients inhibits the harmful effects of PTH, thus potentially lowering the risk of related health issues​​.</p>
<h5 id="milk-consumption-and-pth">Milk Consumption and PTH</h5>
<p>Peat draws attention to the correlation between milk consumption and lower PTH levels. He suggests that drinking milk, rich in calcium and vitamin D, can help in lowering PTH. This is not just beneficial for bone health but also for reducing obesity and related health problems like hypertension, insulin resistance, heart arrhythmias, depression, and various inflammatory conditions. He notes that studies have shown that those who drink milk regularly tend to be less overweight than those who avoid it​​.</p>
<h5 id="hyperparathyroidism-and-hair-loss">Hyperparathyroidism and Hair Loss</h5>
<p>Peat also discusses the impact of hyperparathyroidism on hair loss. He states that elevated levels of PTH can end the growth cycle of hair follicles, leading to hair loss. This is especially notable as many people observe significant hair shedding, mainly in the morning. A simple practice like drinking a glass of milk before bedtime could potentially offer a protective effect against both bone loss and hair loss​​.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In conclusion, Peat&rsquo;s perspective suggests that managing dietary intake, particularly focusing on reducing phosphate-rich foods while increasing calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D—either through diet or supplements—can effectively lower parathyroid hormone levels. Additionally, regular consumption of milk could be a simple yet effective way to manage PTH levels, with potential benefits for bone health, weight management, and even hair preservation.</p>
