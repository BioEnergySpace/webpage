      <description>Progesterone, commonly associated with pregnancy and fertility, extends far beyond these roles, serving as a cornerstone hormone essential for overall health. Initially discovered as the main hormone produced by the ovaries, its significance has been underestimated due to its association with pregnancy. However, Ray Peat, a renowned researcher, emphasizes that progesterone is the most protective hormone the body produces, vital for both men and women in various physiological aspects​​​​.
Protective Role in Pregnancy and Beyond Progesterone&amp;rsquo;s protective qualities are most evident during pregnancy, where it safeguards both the mother and the developing fetus from stress.</description>
